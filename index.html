		<blockquote>
			Do not go gentle into that good night
<br>			Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953

<br>			Do not go gentle into that good night,
<br>			Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
<br>			Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

<br>			Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
<br>			Because their words had forked no lightning they
<br>			Do not go gentle into that good night.

<br>			Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
<br>			Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
<br>			Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

<br>			Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
<br>			And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
<br>			Do not go gentle into that good night.

<br>			Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
<br>			Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
<br>			Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

<br>			And you, my father, there on the sad height,
<br>			Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
<br>			Do not go gentle into that good night.
<br>			Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
